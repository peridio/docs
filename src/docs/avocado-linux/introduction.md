## Rethinking Embedded Linux Development

Avocado OS is a productized, production-ready Embedded Linux build system â€” designed to give you the flexibility of Yocto without the steep learning curve or months of bring-up.

With day-one BSPs for leading hardware targets, a fully open-source foundation, and built-in extensibility, Avocado OS lets your team focus on building applications â€” not wrestling with the OS.

## Why We Built It

Getting started with embedded Linux is harder than it should be.

- Vendor BSPs are inconsistent.
- Yocto is powerful but intimidating.
- Production readiness often comes as an afterthought.

The result? Delayed launches, brittle builds, and an OS stack that's hard to maintain over the product lifecycle.

Avocado OS changes that. It delivers a stable, tested baseline with production-ready configurations â€” right out of the box.

## What Makes Avocado OS Different

**Production-Ready from Day One** â€“ Secure boot, rollback, and update mechanisms built-in.

**Extensible, Not Opaque** â€“ Customize everything, no black boxes.

**Day-One BSPs** â€“ For common EVKs and commodity-grade hardware.

**Developer-Friendly Workflows** â€“ Hardware-in-the-loop development, live workflows, and pre-built templates.

**Open Source** â€“ Built in the open, part of the Yocto Project and Linux Foundation.

## How It Works with Peridio Core

Avocado OS gives you the operating system and development tooling to get to your first working build quickly. Peridio Core takes over when your devices hit the field â€” providing updates, monitoring, and secure access.

## What You'll Find Inside the Avocado OS Documentation

Once you dive into the Avocado OS section of the Development Center, you'll find in-depth technical guides and reference material, including:

**Architecture Overview** â€“ System components, extension model, and boot process.

**Development Environment** â€“ SDK setup, cross-compilation toolchain, and live development workflow.

**System Extensions** â€“ How to create, customize, and debug extensions.

**Build & Provisioning** â€“ Key management, device tree configuration, and secure provisioning.

**Security Implementation** â€“ Secure boot, dm-verity setup, LUKS encryption.

**Update Mechanisms** â€“ Atomic updates, rollback procedures, recovery modes.

**Porting Guide** â€“ BSP assessment, driver integration, and validation testing.

Each guide is written for production realities â€” not just "hello world" examples.

## Stay in Touch & Get Involved

Avocado OS is built in the open, and we rely on feedback and contributions from the community. Here's how you can engage:

**Join the Community** â€“ Our public Discord server is the fastest way to get help and share ideas.

**Request Hardware Support** â€“ If your target isn't yet supported, tell us. We're always adding new platforms.

**Contribute** â€“ From code contributions to documentation improvements, we welcome it all.

**Follow Updates** â€“ Keep up with releases, guides, and new hardware support on our GitHub and mailing list.
