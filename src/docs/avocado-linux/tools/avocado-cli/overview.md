The Avocado CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to initialize, configure, build, and provision Avocado OS projects.

The CLI provides comprehensive functionality for managing the entire Avocado OS development lifecycle. Core capabilities include project initialization with target architecture support, building and managing SDK environments for cross-compilation, creating and packaging system extensions (sysext) and configuration extensions (confext), building runtime images, and deploying to target devices.

Advanced features include hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) testing server support, dependency management with DNF integration, repository metadata fetching and refreshing, container-based development workflows, and flexible provisioning profiles.
