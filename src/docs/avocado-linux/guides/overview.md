Step-by-step tutorials to get you building with Avocado Linux, from initial setup through advanced development techniques.

## Start here

**[Getting started](./getting-started.md)**

The getting started guide will walk you through three related guides: provisioning, hardware-in-the-loop development, and sideloading. This will give you a sense of how it feels to interact with Avocado Linux, and empower you to further explore its capabilities.

## Hardware-specific guides

Platform-specific provisioning instructions that follow the same core workflows.

### Virtual machines

- **[QEMU x86-64](../../hardware/qemu/x86-64/provision/)** — Quickest way to experience Avocado without physical hardware
- **[QEMU ARM](../../hardware/qemu/arm/provision/)** — ARM-based virtual machine for cross-compilation testing

### Physical hardware

- **[NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano](../../hardware/nvidia/jetson-orin-nano-developer-kit/provision)** — AI/ML edge platform with GPU acceleration
- **[Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](../../hardware/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/provision)** — Popular single-board computer for IoT and learning

## Individual workflow guides

These guides are also linked from the getting started meta guide:

- **[Hardware-in-the-loop](./hardware-in-the-loop.md)** — Iterate at web development speeds with live code mounting
- **[Sideload an update](./sideloading.md)** — Push updates directly from your development machine

## Getting help

If you encounter issues while following these guides, check the [community resources](../community.md) for support options.
