Peridio Core is a comprehensive device fleet management platform for embedded and distributed systems that resolves the complexity of secure device operations through sophisticated binary distribution, cryptographic verification, and real-time orchestration capabilities. Unlike traditional embedded deployment approaches, it combines enterprise-grade security features including code signing with hardware-backed key management, certificate-based device authentication, and granular access controls with streamlined development workflows through [cloud delegated updates](./guides/cloud-integration/cloud-delegated-updates), [remote access tunnels](./guides/remote-access/creating-tunnels), and comprehensive fleet visibility. The platform provides flexible [binary management](./reference/binary-management/binaries) with artifact versioning, immutable [bundle distribution](./reference/bundle-management/bundles) through configurable [release channels](./reference/bundle-management/release-channels), and seamless integration capabilities via webhooks and APIs that transform embedded device operations from manual, error-prone processes into automated, scalable fleet management that supports everything from prototype to production deployments across diverse hardware platforms.

## Getting started

Ready to experience this unified development-to-production workflow? Start with [getting started](./guides/getting-started) to create your first signed binary and see how Peridio Core transforms embedded device management from a complex, fragmented process into an efficient, secure experience that scales from single devices to global fleets.
