description: 'Artifact versions in Peridio Core define versioning for binaries - organize target-specific binaries within artifact types for structured deployment.'

Artifact versions define a version for your [binaries](/peridio-core/reference/binary-management/binaries).

For example, you may create an artifact version "1.0.0" for an [artifact](/peridio-core/reference/binary-management/artifacts) "ML-Model". Within that version you would create target-specific binaries.
