# Avocado CLI

The Avocado Command Line Interface (CLI) is a comprehensive development tool for building, deploying, and managing Avocado OS embedded Linux systems. Built in Rust for performance and reliability, the CLI streamlines the entire embedded development workflow from project initialization to production deployment. It provides seamless integration with Avocado's layered architecture, enabling developers to create modular system extensions, build deterministic runtime images, and deploy applications across diverse hardware platforms including ARM, x86, and RISC-V architectures. The CLI supports containerized development environments, live code reloading, and hardware-in-the-loop testing, making embedded development as agile as modern web development while maintaining production-grade security and reliability.
