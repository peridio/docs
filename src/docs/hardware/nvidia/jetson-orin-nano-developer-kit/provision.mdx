# Provision

This guide will walk you through the process of provisioning an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano using the Avocado CLI. For general information on provisioning, see the <Link href="/avocado-linux/references/provisioning">provisioning reference</Link>.

## Prerequisites

- NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit
  - An NVMe SSD (M.2 2280 form factor)
- Host machine
  - Ubuntu 22.04+ or Fedora 39+ per <Link href="/avocado-linux/references/provisioning#reliable-provisioning">reliable provisioning</Link>
  - Support for `binfmt_misc` and `qemu-user-static`
  - 16 GB available disk space
  - The latest version of the <Link href="/avocado-linux/tools/avocado-cli/overview">Avocado CLI</Link>
- Accessories
  - A host-compatible-USB to 3.3 V TTY UART adapter for serial console access
  - A host-compatible-USB to USB-C cable for provisioning

## Connect GPIO

Locate the horizontal GPIO pins beneath the module on the topside of the carrier board:

- Boot into recovery mode by shorting FC_REC to GND:
  - <span style={{ color: 'blue' }}>blue</span>-<span style={{ color: 'blue' }}>blue</span>: short
    FC_REC to GND
- Connect your serial console adapter to the target device. This will allow you to monitor the boot process and interact with shells:
  - <span style={{ color: 'violet' }}>violet</span>: GND to adapter UART GND
  - <span style={{ color: 'green' }}>green</span>: UART TX to adapter UART RX
  - <span style={{ color: 'blue' }}>blue</span>: UART RX to adapter UART TX

  />
</p>

Connect to the serial console with a program like `tio`:

<CodeBlock language="text" title="Host machine">
  {`tio -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
[03:26:54.521] tio 3.9
[03:26:54.521] Press ctrl-t q to quit
[03:26:54.521] Warning: Could not open /dev/ttyUSB0 (No such file or directory)
[03:26:54.521] Waiting for tty device..`}
</CodeBlock>

Replace <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> with the appropriate device path for your serial adapter.

## Connect USB

Connect the target device USB C to a host machine USB.

Verify the target device is detected via USB only after having powered it, for example:

<CodeBlock language="text" title="Host machine">
  {`lsusb
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 035: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 Serial (UART) IC
Bus 002 Device 060: ID 0955:7523 NVIDIA Corp. APX`}
</CodeBlock>

The NVIDIA entry in the list of USB devices showing up after powering the device indicates it is connected to the host machine.

## Create project

Create the project directory and install dependencies.

<CodeBlock title="Host machine">
  {`avocado init --target jetson-orin-nano-devkit jetson-orin-nano-devkit && cd jetson-orin-nano-devkit
avocado install --force`}
</CodeBlock>

## Provision

Build the project and execute the provisioning procedure. This will build the system image and flash it to your target hardware.

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="Host machine">
  {`avocado build
avocado provision -r dev --provision-profile tegraflash`}
</CodeBlock>

The procedure will advance through a few steps:

```
== Step 1: Signing binaries at 2025-10-13T12:18:56+00:00 ==
...
== Step 2: Boot Jetson via RCM at 2025-10-13T12:19:27+00:00 ==
...
== Step 3: Sending flash sequence commands at 2025-10-13T12:19:41+00:00 ==
...
```

During step 3, you will need to disconnect and reconnect the USB C cable from the target device.

Wait till you see:

```text
The Jetson device is waiting for USB disconnect to proceed.
Please manually disconnect and reconnect the USB cable now.

Steps:
  1. Unplug the USB-C cable from the Jetson device
  2. Wait 2-3 seconds
  3. Plug the USB-C cable back in

Press Enter after reconnecting the USB cable...
```

Then do as it instructs, which will advance to step 4:

```text
== Step 4: Writing partitions on external storage device at 2025-10-13T12:23:11+00:00 ==
```

Wait until you see:

```text
== Step 5: Waiting for final status from device at 2025-10-13T12:27:40+00:00 ==
Waiting for USB storage device flashpkg from 52e6d9b7.......
```

Once you see the above, perform the same reconnection procedure:

1. Unplug the USB-C cable from the Jetson device
2. Wait 2-3 seconds
3. Plug the USB-C cable back in

This will allow the provisioning process to complete:

```text
[SUCCESS] Successfully provisioned runtime 'dev'
```

1. Remove power from the target device
2. Remove the jumper shorting FC_REC to GND to prevent the device from booting into recovery mode
3. Remove the USB C cable from the target device
4. Leave the serial console adapter connected

## Run

Apply power to the device. The device will boot with the provisioned system. The `root` user is passwordless in the `dev` runtime used by this guide.
