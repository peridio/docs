# External CDN & Custom Binary Backends Overview

External CDN integration allows you to use your own content delivery network and storage infrastructure with Peridio, providing enhanced control, performance, and cost optimization for your firmware distribution needs.

## What Are Custom Binary Backends?

Custom binary backends enable you to store and distribute firmware binaries using your own cloud storage and CDN infrastructure while maintaining full integration with Peridio's device management platform. Instead of relying solely on Peridio's default storage, you can leverage your existing cloud contracts and infrastructure.

## Key Benefits

### Performance Optimization

- **Global distribution** - Serve binaries from edge locations closest to your devices
- **Reduced latency** - Minimize download times with strategically placed content
- **Bandwidth optimization** - Leverage CDN caching to reduce origin server load
- **Parallel downloads** - Support for multipart downloads and resume capabilities

### Cost Control

- **Existing contracts** - Utilize your current cloud storage agreements
- **Traffic optimization** - Reduce costs through intelligent caching strategies
- **Regional pricing** - Take advantage of regional pricing differences
- **Predictable billing** - Better control over storage and bandwidth costs

### Compliance & Security

- **Data sovereignty** - Keep binaries in specific geographic regions
- **Regulatory compliance** - Meet industry-specific storage requirements
- **Enhanced security** - Time-limited signed URLs for secure downloads
- **Access control** - Granular permissions and audit trails

### Operational Benefits

- **Infrastructure control** - Full visibility into your storage and distribution
- **Monitoring integration** - Use your existing monitoring and alerting systems
- **Backup strategies** - Implement your own backup and disaster recovery
- **Vendor diversity** - Reduce dependency on single cloud providers

## Supported Platforms

Peridio currently supports the following cloud platforms for custom binary backends:

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

- **Amazon S3** - Primary storage backend with regional flexibility
- **Amazon CloudFront** - Global CDN with signed URL capabilities
- **Cross-region replication** - Built-in redundancy options
- **Integrated monitoring** - CloudWatch metrics and logging

### Coming Soon

- **Google Cloud Platform** - Cloud Storage and Cloud CDN integration
- **Microsoft Azure** - Blob Storage and Azure CDN support
- **Multi-cloud strategies** - Cross-platform distribution scenarios

### How It Works

1. **Binary Upload** - Firmware binaries are uploaded to your designated storage backend
2. **Distribution Setup** - CDN configuration ensures global availability
3. **Device Requests** - Peridio generates secure, time-limited download URLs
4. **Content Delivery** - Devices download directly from your CDN edge locations
5. **Monitoring** - Full visibility into download metrics and performance

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Deployments

- Large-scale IoT deployments requiring guaranteed SLAs
- Enterprises with existing cloud infrastructure investments
- Organizations with strict data governance requirements

### Geographic Distribution

- Global device fleets requiring optimized regional performance
- Compliance with local data residency requirements
- Multi-region redundancy strategies

### High-Volume Scenarios

- Frequent firmware updates across large device populations
- Bandwidth-intensive applications (video, ML models, etc.)
- Cost-sensitive deployments requiring optimal pricing

### Development & Testing

- Staging environments with isolated storage
- A/B testing scenarios with different distribution strategies
- Development workflows requiring rapid iteration

## Security Model

### Authentication & Authorization

- **IAM integration** - Leverage cloud provider identity management
- **Least privilege access** - Minimal required permissions
- **External ID validation** - Additional security layer using organization IDs

### Secure Distribution

- **Signed URLs** - Time-limited, authenticated download links
- **Encryption in transit** - TLS/SSL for all communications
- **Encryption at rest** - Cloud provider encryption capabilities
- **Access logging** - Comprehensive audit trails

### Best Practices

- Regular key rotation for signing operations
- Monitoring and alerting for unusual access patterns
- Network security groups and firewall configurations
- Regular security assessments and compliance audits

## Getting Started

### Planning Your Implementation

1. **Assess Requirements**
   - Determine geographic distribution needs
   - Evaluate compliance and security requirements
   - Estimate bandwidth and storage requirements
   - Consider existing cloud infrastructure

2. **Choose Your Stack**
   - Select primary storage backend (S3, etc.)
   - Decide on CDN requirements (CloudFront, etc.)
   - Plan for monitoring and alerting
   - Consider backup and disaster recovery

3. **Implementation Phases**
   - Phase 1: Basic storage backend setup
   - Phase 2: CDN integration and optimization
   - Phase 3: Advanced features and monitoring
   - Phase 4: Performance tuning and cost optimization
