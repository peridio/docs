# Authorization Scopes

Authorization Scopes are namespaces over groups of functionality. In order to leverage functionality in Peridio, you have to be explicitly allowed to use the required Authorization Scope(s). By default you are implicitly denied from all Authorization Scopes. Authorization Policies can be used to explicitly allow or deny Authorization Scopes in a reusable manner.
