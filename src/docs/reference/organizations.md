An Organization is a container for your resources. You create and manage your resources in an Organization, and the Organization provides administrative capabilities for access and billing.

Using multiple Organizations is a best practice for scaling your environment, as it provides a natural billing boundary for costs, isolates resources for security, gives flexibility or individuals and teams, in addition to being adaptable for new business processes.

## User Access

Users within an organization with a role of `admin` are able to invite other users to that organization. As part of this process the inviter will choose a role level for the invited which will dictate their access level to the organization in general.
