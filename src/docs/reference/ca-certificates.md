Generally, a CA certificate is an X.509 certificate that signs other X.509 certificates. In the context of Peridio, they are optionally used to control the registration of [device certificates](device-certificates) during [just in time provisioning](just-in-time-provisioning).

To learn more about how to use CA certificates, see the [creating CA certificates](/guides/creating-ca-certificates) guide.
