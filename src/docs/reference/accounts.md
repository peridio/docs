# Accounts

An Account is a container for your resources. You create and manage your resources in an Account, and the Account provides administrative capabilities for access and billing.

Using multiple Accounts is a best practice for scaling your environment, as it provides a natural billing boundary for costs, isolates resources for security, gives flexibility or individuals and teams, in addition to being adaptable for new business processes.
