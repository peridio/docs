# Artifacts

An artifact is the logical representation of an asset you wish to version and distribute to devices. For example, `RTX ML Model` may be the `name` of your artifact. Note that the artifact itself is neither a version nor a binary, as those are distinctly manageable resources. See [artifact versions](/reference/artifact-versions.md) and [binaries](/reference/binaries.md).
