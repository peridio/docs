# ðŸš§ Hardware in the Loop Development

:::info Under Construction
This page is currently being developed. Check back soon for comprehensive documentation on Hardware in the Loop (HIL) development with Avocado OS.
:::

## Coming Soon

This guide will cover:

### HIL Testing Infrastructure

- Setting up automated test benches
- Integrating real hardware with CI/CD pipelines
- Remote device access and control
- Power cycling and boot management

### Test Automation

- Automated firmware flashing
- Test suite execution on real hardware
- Performance benchmarking
- Regression testing strategies

### Development Workflows

- Remote debugging on target hardware
- Live kernel development
- Driver development and testing
- Real-time system validation

### Continuous Integration

- Jenkins integration for HIL testing
- GitLab CI/CD with hardware runners
- GitHub Actions for embedded testing
- Test result aggregation and reporting

### Hardware Farm Management

- Device pool management
- Resource scheduling and allocation
- Multi-device test scenarios
- Hardware health monitoring

### Tools and Frameworks

- LAVA (Linaro Automation and Validation Architecture)
- Robot Framework for embedded testing
- Custom test harness development
- Serial console automation

## Prerequisites (Planned)

- Physical hardware setup with remote access
- Serial console access (UART/USB)
- Network-controlled power distribution
- CI/CD infrastructure
- Test automation framework
