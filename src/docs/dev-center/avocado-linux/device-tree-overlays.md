# ðŸš§ Device Tree Overlays

:::info Under Construction
This page is currently being developed. Check back soon for comprehensive documentation on device tree overlays in Avocado OS.
:::

## Coming Soon

This guide will cover:

### Understanding Device Trees

- Device tree basics and syntax
- Hardware description fundamentals
- Relationship to kernel drivers
- Boot-time vs runtime configuration

### Device Tree Overlays (DTO)

- What are overlays and why use them
- Overlay syntax and structure
- Fragment-based modifications
- Symbol resolution and phandles

### Creating Overlays

```dts
// Example overlay (coming soon)
/dts-v1/;
/plugin/;

/ {
    compatible = "brcm,bcm2835";

    fragment@0 {
        target = <&spi0>;
        __overlay__ {
            status = "okay";
            // Additional configuration
        };
    };
};
```

### Common Use Cases

- **GPIO Configuration**: Pin multiplexing and functions
- **I2C/SPI Devices**: Adding sensor support
- **Display Configuration**: HDMI, MIPI DSI, LVDS
- **Audio Devices**: I2S, codec configuration
- **Network Interfaces**: Ethernet PHY settings
- **Custom Hardware**: HAT and expansion boards

### Platform-Specific Guides

- **Raspberry Pi**: Using dtoverlay and config.txt
- **NXP i.MX**: U-Boot and overlay loading
- **NVIDIA Jetson**: Device tree customization
- **BeagleBone**: Cape manager and slots

### Building and Compiling

```bash
# Example commands (coming soon)
dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o my-overlay.dtbo my-overlay.dts
avocado-build dtbo my-overlay
```

### Runtime Management

- Loading overlays at boot
- Dynamic overlay application
- Overlay parameters and configuration
- Debugging overlay issues
- Overlay conflicts and resolution

### Integration with Avocado OS

- Overlay storage and management
- System extension packaging
- OTA updates for overlays
- Per-device overlay configuration
- Fleet-wide overlay deployment

### Advanced Topics

- Overlay dependencies
- Conditional overlays
- Multi-board support
- Overlay validation
- Security considerations

### Debugging Tools

```bash
# Coming soon: Debugging examples
dtc -I fs -O dts /proc/device-tree
cat /sys/kernel/debug/devices
vcdbg log msg
```

## Hardware Examples

### Enabling I2C Device

```dts
// Coming soon: Complete I2C sensor example
/dts-v1/;
/plugin/;

/ {
    fragment@0 {
        target = <&i2c1>;
        __overlay__ {
            #address-cells = <1>;
            #size-cells = <0>;

            sensor@48 {
                compatible = "ti,tmp102";
                reg = <0x48>;
            };
        };
    };
};
```

### Custom GPIO Configuration

```dts
// Coming soon: GPIO configuration example
```

## Prerequisites (Planned)

- Understanding of hardware interfaces
- Basic knowledge of device tree syntax
- Target hardware with overlay support
- Device tree compiler (dtc)
