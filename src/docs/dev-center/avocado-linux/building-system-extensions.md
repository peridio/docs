# ðŸš§ Building System Extensions

:::info Under Construction
This page is currently being developed. Check back soon for comprehensive documentation on building system extensions for Avocado OS.
:::

## Coming Soon

This guide will cover:

### Understanding System Extensions
- What are systemd system extensions
- Benefits over traditional package management
- Immutable root filesystem architecture
- Extension layering and composition

### Creating Extensions
- Extension directory structure
- Metadata requirements (`extension-release`)
- Version compatibility
- Dependencies and conflicts

### Building with Avocado SDK
```bash
# Example commands (coming soon)
avocado-repo sysext install <package>
avocado-build sysext <extension-name>
avocado-sysext validate
```

### Extension Types
- **Application Extensions**: User-space applications
- **Service Extensions**: System services and daemons
- **Driver Extensions**: Kernel modules and firmware
- **Library Extensions**: Shared libraries and frameworks
- **Configuration Extensions**: System configuration overlays

### Advanced Topics
- Multi-architecture extensions
- Signed extensions for secure boot
- Delta updates for extensions
- Extension dependencies and ordering
- Runtime extension management

### Best Practices
- Minimizing extension size
- Security considerations
- Version management strategies
- Testing and validation
- Documentation requirements

### Integration with Peridio
- OTA updates for extensions
- Extension deployment strategies
- A/B testing with extensions
- Rollback mechanisms
- Fleet-wide extension management

## Example: Creating a Simple Extension

```bash
# Coming soon: Step-by-step tutorial
# 1. Set up development environment
# 2. Create extension structure
# 3. Add application binaries
# 4. Configure metadata
# 5. Build and sign extension
# 6. Test on target device
# 7. Deploy via Peridio
```

## Prerequisites (Planned)

- Avocado SDK installed
- Understanding of systemd concepts
- Target hardware or QEMU setup
- Peridio account for deployment
