# Certificate Management Overview

Device authentication and security in Peridio relies on X.509 certificates for device identity and communication security.

## Core Concepts

Peridio uses a comprehensive certificate management system that provides:

- **Device Authentication** - Cryptographic proof of device identity
- **Secure Communication** - TLS/SSL encrypted connections
- **Firmware Validation** - Code signing and verification
- **Trust Chain Management** - Hierarchical certificate authorities

## Certificate Components

The Peridio certificate infrastructure consists of:

- **Certificate Authorities (CAs)** - Root and intermediate trust anchors
- **Device Certificates** - Individual device identity credentials
- **Signing Keys** - Code signing certificates for firmware
- **Verification Certificates** - Platform validation certificates

## Getting Started

1. **Plan Your PKI** - Design your certificate hierarchy
2. **Create CAs** - Establish root and intermediate authorities
3. **Generate Device Certificates** - Issue device credentials
4. **Configure Signing** - Set up firmware signing keys
5. **Deploy to Devices** - Install certificates securely

## Management Options

### Self-Managed

Full control over your PKI infrastructure:

- Generate and manage your own CAs
- Issue device certificates manually
- Handle rotation and revocation

### Platform-Managed

Let Peridio handle the complexity:

- Automated certificate generation
- Built-in rotation policies
- Integrated revocation management

## Security Considerations

- Store private keys securely
- Use hardware security modules when possible
- Implement regular rotation schedules
- Monitor certificate expiration
- Plan for emergency revocation
