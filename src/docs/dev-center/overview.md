# Welcome to the Peridio Development Center

The fastest way to go from new hardware on your desk to production devices in the field.

We've built this Development Center to give embedded Linux developers a single, unified home for everything you need to build, test, deploy, and manage connected devices — powered by Avocado OS and Peridio Core.

Whether you're starting with an evaluation kit or scaling commodity-grade hardware into thousands of field devices, our goal is simple: remove the uncertainty, delays, and frustration that traditionally slow down embedded product teams.

## Why We Built It

Embedded Linux development is powerful — but it's also messy. Vendor BSPs vary in quality, Yocto has a steep learning curve, and integrating over-the-air updates, observability, and security is time-consuming.

By combining Avocado OS (production-ready Embedded Linux build system) with Peridio Core (secure device management + OTA), you get a clear, supported path from prototype to production.

## What You'll Find Here

The Dev Center is designed to be your step-by-step guide:

**Provision a Device** – Get your target hardware or virtualized environment up and running in minutes.

**Hardware-in-the-Loop Development** – Validate your system in real-world conditions before shipping.

**On-Desk Device Updates** - Local validation and test of OTA workflows

**First OTA Update** – Learn how to deploy changes to devices in the field — safely and securely.

Every guide is production-focused — the same processes you use on day one will carry through to deployment and maintenance.

## What You'll Be Able to Do

By the time you've completed the Getting Started path, you'll have:

- A working device running Avocado OS.
- An application deployed using our development workflow.
- A tested OTA update pipeline to manage future releases.
- Confidence that your approach is production-ready from the start.
