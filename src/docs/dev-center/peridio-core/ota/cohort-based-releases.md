# Cohort-Based Releases

Cohort-Based Releases provide a sophisticated mechanism for progressive rollouts and controlled deployment strategies across your device fleet. By organizing devices into cohorts based on characteristics such as hardware version, geographic location, customer tier, or risk tolerance, you can implement phased deployments that minimize risk and ensure update stability. This approach enables canary deployments, A/B testing, and gradual rollouts that allow you to monitor update performance and catch issues before they affect your entire fleet, while also supporting complex deployment scenarios like region-specific updates or customer-specific feature releases.
