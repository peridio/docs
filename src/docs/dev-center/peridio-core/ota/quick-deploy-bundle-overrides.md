# Quick Deploy / Bundle Overrides

Quick Deploy and Bundle Overrides offer a powerful mechanism for rapidly deploying critical updates or temporarily superseding standard release schedules when immediate action is required. This feature allows operators to push emergency patches, security fixes, or critical bug fixes to devices without waiting for the normal release cycle, while maintaining full audit trails and rollback capabilities. Bundle overrides can target specific devices or cohorts, automatically expire after a defined period, and seamlessly revert to standard release channels once the override period ends, making them ideal for time-sensitive deployments that require immediate remediation without permanently disrupting your release management strategy.
