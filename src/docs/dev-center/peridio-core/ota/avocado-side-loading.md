# Avocado OS Side Loading

Avocado OS Side Loading enables direct deployment of updates to devices running Avocado OS without requiring the traditional release channel workflow. This capability is particularly useful for development, testing, and rapid prototyping scenarios where immediate update deployment is necessary. Side loading bypasses standard release gates and allows developers to push updates directly to specific devices or device groups, making it an essential tool for debugging production issues or deploying emergency patches when standard release processes would introduce unacceptable delays.
