This guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step walkthrough for deploying firmware updates directly from your desktop to embedded devices using Avocado OS's powerful sideloading capabilities. By leveraging Avocado OS sideloading, you can rapidly test and deploy firmware iterations without requiring a full cloud infrastructure setup, making it ideal for development environments, proof-of-concepts, and situations where direct device access is preferred. This approach streamlines the development workflow by allowing you to push updates directly from your workstation to target devices while maintaining the security and reliability features built into the Avocado OS update system.
