## Production Vision Applications

### Automated Optical Inspection (AOI)
Deploy 100 TOPS of AI performance for real-time defect detection on high-speed production lines. Process multiple inspection models simultaneously with sub-10ms latency.

### Industrial Safety & Compliance
Monitor PPE compliance, detect safety violations, and track worker movement patterns. Edge processing ensures privacy compliance without cloud data transmission.

### Smart Factory Analytics
Real-time production monitoring with on-device inference for quality metrics, throughput optimization, and predictive maintenance triggers.

## From Development Complexity to Production Simplicity

### The Traditional Vision System Challenge
- **18-month custom integration** for production vision deployment
- **Manual on-camera updates** that don't scale across facilities
- **Complex AI model lifecycle** without version control
- **No unified management** across camera fleets
- **Limited remote diagnostics** when vision systems fail

### The Avocado OS Solution
- **Production-ready in weeks** with pre-configured vision BSPs
- **Atomic OTA updates** for models, firmware, and applications
- **Built-in DeepStream SDK** with TensorRT optimization
- **Cross-camera orchestration** with centralized management
- **Enterprise remote diagnostics** with secure tunnel access
