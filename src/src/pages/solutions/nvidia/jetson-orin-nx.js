    title: "Solution Overview",
    content: "The NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, powered by Avocado Linux and Peridio Fleet, transforms high-performance edge AI development from a multi-year engineering project into a production deployment measured in days. This integrated platform delivers up to 100 TOPS of AI performance (157 TOPS in Super Mode) with enterprise-grade Linux, atomic OTA updates, and fleet management built in from day one. Ideal for robotics, drones, industrial AI, and multi-sensor vision systems, the Orin NX balances compute power, efficiency, and small form factor. By eliminating the traditional 18-month journey from developer kit to production system, teams can focus on their AI applications instead of infrastructure. The result is a secure, scalable edge AI platform that's ready for industrial deployment out of the box, with 10+ years of support and pin-compatibility with the entire Orin family."
