## From Challenge to Solution
Transform your reTerminal deployment with production-ready infrastructure

### The Challenge
- Weeks to configure each HMI manually with custom SD card images
- No rollback when UI updates fail in production
- Consumer-grade OS unsuitable for 24/7 industrial operation
- Custom BSP development for each deployment scenario
- No centralized visibility across distributed HMI fleets

### The Solution
- Deploy 100s of HMIs in hours with zero-touch provisioning
- Atomic updates with instant rollback on failure
- Industrial Linux with real-time kernel and 10-year support
- Pre-integrated BSP with GPU acceleration out-of-the-box
- Single dashboard for monitoring and managing entire fleet
