## From Challenge to Solution
Transform your Raspberry Pi development workflow with enterprise-grade infrastructure

### The Challenge
- Prototypes work great, production deployment fails
- SD card corruption in industrial environments
- No secure OTA update mechanism
- Manual fleet management doesn't scale
- Security vulnerabilities in default OS

### The Solution
- Production-hardened Linux OS
- Read-only root with atomic updates
- Enterprise OTA orchestration
- Centralized fleet management
- Built-in security compliance

## Why Choose Peridio for Raspberry Pi

### Production Hardening
Read-only root filesystem, secure boot, and A/B partitioning eliminate SD card corruption and failed updates.

### Fleet-Scale OTA
Deploy updates to thousands of devices with phased rollouts, rollback capabilities, and real-time monitoring.

### Zero-Trust Security
Code signing, device certificates, and encrypted communication secure your entire fleet from day one.

### Rapid Development
Pre-built Yocto layers and containerized applications accelerate your time-to-market from months to weeks.

### Cross-Platform Ready
Develop on Pi, deploy across ARM architectures. Reuse software stacks on industrial SoCs when you scale.

### Fleet Intelligence
Real-time telemetry, remote diagnostics, and predictive maintenance keep your devices healthy and operational.
