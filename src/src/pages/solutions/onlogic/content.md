## Production Gateway Applications

### Factory Data Aggregation

Consolidate data from PLCs, sensors, and SCADA systems. Process and filter industrial protocols before cloud transmission with built-in security.

### Remote Site Management

Manage distributed industrial equipment with secure remote access tunnels. Monitor system health and perform maintenance without site visits.

### Protocol Bridge Gateway

Convert between industrial protocols (Modbus, OPC-UA, CAN) and modern APIs. Enable legacy equipment integration with cloud platforms.

## From Development Complexity to Production Simplicity

### The Traditional Gateway Challenge

- **18-month custom Linux builds** for production deployment
- **Manual on-site updates** that don't scale across sites
- **Complex integration** of industrial protocols and security
- **Vendor lock-in** with proprietary gateway solutions
- **No remote diagnostics** when systems fail in the field

### The Avocado OS Solution

- **Production-ready in weeks** with pre-built industrial BSPs
- **Atomic OTA updates** with automatic rollback protection
- **Built-in protocol support** for Modbus, OPC-UA, and CAN
- **Cross-platform deployment** - same software, any hardware
- **Enterprise remote diagnostics** with secure tunnel access
