# Provisioning Map

`provision.fields` is an optional, manifest-level map that decorates the
environment variables surfaced through `provision.envs` with type information
and UI hints. It exists so external tooling can render an appropriate input
control for each variable when prompting the user to provision a target.

stone itself does not consume this map. The values supplied for each variable
still reach profile scripts through stone's existing `${VAR}` expansion path
(see [Usage](/developer-reference/stone/usage)); `fields` only describes how
those variables should be collected.

## Shape

```jsonc
"provision": {
  "envs": {
    "device_info": {
      "AVOCADO_DEVICE_CERT": "${AVOCADO_DEVICE_CERT}",
      "AVOCADO_DEVICE_KEY":  "${AVOCADO_DEVICE_KEY}",
      "AVOCADO_DEVICE_ID":   "${AVOCADO_DEVICE_ID}"
    },
    "cmdline": {
      "AVOCADO_CMDLINE_EXTRA": "${AVOCADO_CMDLINE_EXTRA}"
    }
  },
  "fields": {
    "AVOCADO_DEVICE_CERT": {
      "type": "file",
      "label": "Device certificate",
      "description": "X.509 device certificate in PEM format."
    },
    "AVOCADO_DEVICE_KEY": {
      "type": "file",
      "label": "Device private key",
      "description": "PEM-encoded private key paired with the device certificate.",
      "secret": true
    },
    "AVOCADO_DEVICE_ID": {
      "type": "string",
      "label": "Device ID",
      "description": "Stable identifier registered with the platform."
    },
    "AVOCADO_CMDLINE_EXTRA": {
      "type": "multiline",
      "label": "Extra kernel command-line",
      "description": "Appended to the default kernel cmdline.",
      "required": false
    }
  },
  "profiles": { "...": "..." }
}
```

The map is keyed by environment variable name (matching keys in
`provision.envs.<block>`). Each entry describes one user-facing input.

## Field spec

| key           | type                                             | required | default            | notes                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`        | `"string" \| "multiline" \| "boolean" \| "file"` | yes      | —                  | The v1 type set. Unknown values should be treated as `"string"`.      |
| `label`       | string                                           | no       | humanized var name | Short label shown beside the input.                                   |
| `description` | string                                           | no       | —                  | One-line help text shown under the label.                             |
| `required`    | boolean                                          | no       | `true`             | When `false`, the user may leave the value empty.                     |
| `default`     | string \| boolean                                | no       | —                  | Pre-filled value (string for text/file types, boolean for `boolean`). |
| `secret`      | boolean                                          | no       | `false`            | Mask in the UI and avoid logging. Applies to any type.                |

Unknown keys are reserved for future revisions and must be ignored.

## Type semantics

- **`string`** — single-line text input. Submitted to stone as the entered
  string.
- **`multiline`** — multi-line text input. Submitted to stone as the entered
  string, including newlines.
- **`boolean`** — two-state input (checkbox/toggle). Wire format is
  presence-based: `true` is submitted as `"1"` and `false` as the empty string.
  This matches the convention already used by the Tegra `ERASE_*` flags
  (`[ "${ERASE_NVME:-0}" = "1" ] && ...`).
- **`file`** — file picker. The file's contents are submitted as a string
  (matching how `${AVOCADO_DEVICE_CERT}`/`${AVOCADO_DEVICE_KEY}` are consumed
  today, where the env var holds the PEM body rather than a path). Combine with
  `secret: true` for private-key inputs.

## Resolution

For a chosen provisioning profile the UI should:

1. Walk `profile.envs` and collect every variable name referenced — for named
   block entries, take the keys of `provision.envs.<block>`; for inline map
   entries, take the keys of the map.
2. Skip entries whose value in `provision.envs` is a literal (no `${VAR}`
   substring) — those are not user input.
3. Look up `provision.fields[<var>]` for each remaining name. A missing entry
   means the variable behaves as `{ "type": "string" }`.
4. Render the union of these fields in declaration order (per profile, then per
   block). A variable referenced from multiple blocks is collected once.

The collected values are placed in the caller's process environment under their
variable names; stone's normal `${VAR}` expansion then drops them into the
manifest before invoking the profile script.

## Why a parallel map (and not inline)

`provision.envs.<block>.<VAR>` values are typed as `string` in stone's manifest
schema and must remain so for stone to keep round-tripping manifests without
changes. Putting the type metadata in a sibling map keeps stone unchanged:
unknown top-level keys under `provision` are silently dropped when
deserializing, and overlay merging round-trips the merged JSON through a generic
value before deserializing into the typed view, so `fields` survives overlay
merging verbatim.

## Versioning

`provision.fields` is additive in v1. Future type identifiers (e.g. `enum`,
`secret-string`, `serial-device`) will be added with their own keys; consumers
should fall back to `"string"` when they encounter an unfamiliar `type`.
