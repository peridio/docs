## Use Case Examples

### Smart Industrial Camera
- Dual-camera (stereo or 2x angle) vision with real-time inference (defect detection, classification)
- Local NPU inference accelerates models (e.g. ResNet/YOLO), minimizing bandwidth and enabling actions at the edge
- M7 core handles real-time control and motion coordination (e.g., actuating pan‑tilt‑zoom or robotic arms)

### Autonomous Inspection System
- Low-latency TSN-based Gigabit connection enabling synchronized multi-sensor deployments
- Persistent vision-based monitoring with voice/NLP support for operator assistants
- Secure remote updates and fleet telemetry cut installation visits by 80 %

### Voice-controlled Industrial Gateway
- Audio streaming and voice recognition via HiFi 4 DSP with wake-word detection handled on-chip
- Peridio’s update framework rolls out capability and model updates safely and reliably
