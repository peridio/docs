## Accelerate Industrial AI on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano with Peridio & Avocado OS

Jetson Orin Nano delivers up to 67 TOPS of AI performance in a tiny 7â€“25 W form factor (8 GB model). It enables industrial-grade AI and robotics in devices as small as a camera or autonomous sensor. However, turning a developer kit into a field-ready product still requires months of embedded Linux work, device management infrastructure, and rigorous security. **Peridio + Avocado OS eliminate that friction:**

* **Production-ready OS built on Yocto â€”** Avocado OS provides deterministic builds and a composable runtime that boots on Jetson in minutes. It includes secure boot, dm-verity, and LUKS encryption and is supported by the Linux Foundation.
* **Fleet management & OTA â€”** Peridio Fleet manages device registrations, cohort-based phased updates, and OTA orchestration. Customers ship updates 3â€“4Ã— faster with unified workflows.
* **Enterprise support â€”** Peridioâ€™s managed Linux service supplies long-term support, CVE patching, and SBOM management. Your team can focus on applications instead of maintaining a custom distribution.

Together, Jetson Orin Nanoâ€™s compute power and Peridio/Avocadoâ€™s software stack let you launch AI-driven products in months, with 10Ã— faster development cycles and 3Ã— fewer resources.

<em>Why it matters:</em> Jetson Orin Nano compresses datacenter-class inference into the smallest Jetson module. Buyers can build compact AI cameras, autonomous mobile robots, or vision sensors that meet industrial-grade requirements.

## How Peridio & Avocado OS unlock Jetson Orin Nano
### End-to-end development pipeline
* **Rapid bring-up â€”** Avocado OS ships with pre-integrated BSPs for Jetson, letting you boot a deterministic Linux in minutes. Hardware-in-the-loop tools reduce iteration cycles from weeks to hours.
* **Composable architecture â€”** Build your system using modular layers and standard secure components. Avoid the fragility of DIY Yocto.
* **Secure & deterministic â€”** Secure boot, dm-verity, and LUKS across all architectures. Reproducible images simplify certification.
* **Fleet operations â€”** Register and manage devices in Peridio Fleet. Use phased releases, cohort targeting, SBOM, and CVE patching.
* **Long-term support â€”** 10+ years of kernel/security maintenance. Combined with Jetsonâ€™s industrial lifecycle, ensures device longevity.

### Competitive advantages
* **Speed to market â€”** Reduces 18-month embedded projects to ~4 months via pre-built BSPs and HIL tools.
* **Cross-platform reuse â€”** Reuse Avocado OS layers across ARM/NPU SoCs (e.g., Qualcomm Rubik Pi 3, MediaTek Genio).
* **Enterprise trust â€”** Open source + Linux Foundation backing builds buyer confidence. ROI: 10Ã— faster cycles, 3Ã— fewer engineers.

## Use-case examples
* **Industrial smart cameras â€”** Use multi-camera CSI input for AI tasks like object detection or quality inspection. OTA supports model updates.
* **Autonomous mobile robots â€”** Real-time processing of sensor fusion and navigation. Avocado OS supports ROS2 and containers; Peridio Fleet enables scalable rollouts.
* **Edge AI gateways â€”** Run generative AI or LLMs locally with NVMe and optional 10-GbE. Managed Linux keeps them secure in harsh environments.
