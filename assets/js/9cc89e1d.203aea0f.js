Often useful for displaying to users\n\n      --name <NAME>\n          The resource\'s name, meant to be displayable to users\n\n      --next-release-prn <NEXT_RELEASE_PRN>\n          The PRN of the release you wish to create this release before.\n          \n          If omitted, the release will be created as latest within the cohort. If there is already at least one release in the cohort, then the latest release in that cohort would have its next_release_prn updated to this created release.\n          \n          If supplied, the release will be created prior to the release identified by next_release_prn.
