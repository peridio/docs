Often useful for displaying to users\n\n      --name <NAME>\n          The resource's name, meant to be displayable to users\n\n      --next-release-prn <NEXT_RELEASE_PRN>\n          The PRN of the release you wish to create this release before.\n          \n          If omitted, the release will be created as latest within the cohort.

Because of this, if there is already a phased release, it must be \"completed\" by setting the phase to 1.\n\n      --previous-release-prn <PREVIOUS_RELEASE_PRN>\n          The PRN of the release you wish to create this release after.\n          \n          If omitted, next_release_prn will dictate where to create this release within the cohort's release graph.\n          \n          In order to insert a release between two other releases, next_release_prn is required to be supplied as well.

You may use this to schedule a future release.\n\n      --version <VERSION>\n          The release version.\n          \n          If provided, it has to be a valid version.
