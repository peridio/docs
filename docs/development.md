# Development

npm commands are executed in the `src` directory.

## Installation

```console
npm --prefix src install
```

This command installs dependencies defined in `src/package.json`.

## Development server

```console
npm --prefix src start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
