# Development

Yarn commands are executed in the `src` directory

## Installation

```console
yarn --cwd src
```

This command installs dependencies defined in `src/package.json`.

## Development Server

```console
yarn --cwd src start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
